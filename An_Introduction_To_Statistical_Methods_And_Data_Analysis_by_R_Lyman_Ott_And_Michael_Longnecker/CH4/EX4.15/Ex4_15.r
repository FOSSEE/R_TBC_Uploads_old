# calculate probability in normal distribution with R
# variable y  with normal distribution N(??, ??), where ??=20 and ?? = 2
# pnorm function gives the probability of a normally distributed random number to be less that the value of a given number.
#  the probability that a measurement will be less than 23 is given by 
pnorm(23,mean =20,sd=2)
