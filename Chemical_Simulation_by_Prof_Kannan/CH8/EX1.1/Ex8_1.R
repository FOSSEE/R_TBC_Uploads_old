"Consider a queueing model in which all customers have service times equal to 1, and where the times between successive customers are always
greater than 1 (for instance, the interarrival times could be uniformly distributed over (1, 2))."

"Hence, as every arrival finds the system empty and every departure leaves it empty, we have:"
a0 = d0 = 1
#an = proportion of customers that find n in the system when they arrive, and
#dn = proportion of customers leaving behind n in the system when they depart

#However,P0 is not equal to 1, as the system is not always empty of customers.
