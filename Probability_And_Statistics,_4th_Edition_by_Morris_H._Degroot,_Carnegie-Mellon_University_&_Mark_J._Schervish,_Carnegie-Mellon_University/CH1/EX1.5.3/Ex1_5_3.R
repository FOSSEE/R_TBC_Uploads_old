# Probabilities of 'B' and 'V' are represented by 'Pr_B' and 'Pr_V' respectively.

Pr_B=0.7
Pr_V=0.4

# As sample space is 'B' Union 'V'. Therefore, probability of 'B' union 'V' or 'Pr_B_union_V' must be 1.

Pr_B_union_V=1

# Probability of both infections is represented by 'Pr_B_inter_V'.

Pr_B_inter_V=Pr_B + Pr_V - Pr_B_union_V;
