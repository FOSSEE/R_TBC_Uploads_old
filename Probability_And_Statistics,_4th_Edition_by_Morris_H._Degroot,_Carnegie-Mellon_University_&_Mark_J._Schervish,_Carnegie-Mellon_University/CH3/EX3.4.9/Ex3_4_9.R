# Radius of the circle from the equation "x^2 + y^2 =< 9", be represented by 'r'.
# "sqrt" function is used to find the square root of input value. "pi" is a constant.
# For more information, type ?sqrt and ?pi in the console.

r<-c(sqrt(9));
c<-1/(pi*r^2);
print(c)

# The answer may slightly vary due to being represented as a real number rather than a fraction.
